<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring project planning in the codebase**

I need to help the user understand how project planning works within this repository, particularly how it interacts with the user through questioning to clarify project objectives. This is an informational task, so I'll explore the codebase for "planning" or interviewing flows, especially in chat components and related files. I'll use broad searches in codebase_search for keywords like "plan," "project," and "clarify," keeping things concise while following communication guidelines.
**Structuring code searches for project planning**

I need to provide code citations using METHOD 1, which means I'll show relevant snippets along with their line numbers and paths. I’m planning to run some codebase_search queries in parallel to investigate how the app handles project planning, where prompts are defined, and how user requirements or project details are captured. I’ll also look at how questions are asked to clarify projects. I'll focus on key directories and utilize multi_tool_use.parallel for efficient searching.</details></think>

---

I'll scan the codebase to locate where the planning and clarification flows are implemented, focusing on chat messaging and any "project planning" logic.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining project planning**

I need to clarify how project planning operates in the repository, focusing on how it asks questions to understand the user's project better. I'll explore the code to locate the discovery and planning prompts. I noticed ChatImplementer logic selecting between ChatMode.Discovery and ChatMode.BuildApp. It seems opening SendChatMessage.ts, which the user had open, could help since it likely contains the logic for assembling and sending prompts. I'll search for definitions of Discovery and BuildApp in the codebase.</details></think>

---

I'll look for how "Discovery" and "Build" modes are defined and how prompts are constructed/sent, then open the key files to read the logic.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring project planning mechanics**

I need to address the user's question about how project planning works, especially focusing on asking clarifying questions. This involves looking into the chat flow, discovery mode, app summary, and how backend prompts assemble. I should check out the SendChatMessage.ts file to understand how messages are sent and constructed. I’ll also explore the messageAppSummary parsing and work on examining other related files in parallel for a comprehensive view of the planning process.
**Planning my reading list**

I’m organizing a plan to read through several key files related to the project. I need to focus on app/lib/replay/SendChatMessage.ts, messageAppSummary.ts, and others related to the chat and planning processes. I'll look for definitions of message structures and the filtering of events in relevant files. I also want to search for terms like "ask questions" and "clarify" to find specifics about the discovery prompt and related strings in the codebase.</details></think>

---

I'll open the key planning-related files and search for where Discovery prompts and clarifying questions are generated to explain the flow.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining project planning in the repo**

The user is asking for an overview of how project planning works in this repo, specifically how it interacts with users for clarification. This is a non-code query, so I need to organize my explanation clearly. Essentially, the system enters Discovery mode by default until there's an app summary. The `MessageInput` displays a Start Planning button when conditions are met, with responses generated from the backend that include various message types, such as clarification questions.
**Looking into UI rendering**

The UI is rendering messages using Markdown, and it's utilizing `onCheckboxChange` when `isActiveDiscoveryResponse` is true, likely allowing for checkboxes. I haven't explored that function yet, but I know it exists somewhere. I’m thinking about searching for `isActiveDiscoveryResponse` next, so I’ll run a grep command to find more details. It’s a good step to clarify how this feature works in the project!</details></think>

---

I'll quickly find where discovery responses are identified as active (e.g., `isActiveDiscoveryResponse`) to explain how checkboxes/questions are handled, then summarize the flow.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining project planning**

I need to explain how project planning works in this repository, focusing on how it asks questions for clarification. This is a read-only summarization task, and the developer instructions say to include code citations and organize the information with headings and bold bullet points. The user’s prompt asks about building intuition regarding the question-asking process. I’ll outline the flow involving different modes in the code, including Discovery and BuildApp, and how the backend generates questions.
**Exploring MessageInput functionality**

I’m looking into how the MessageInput works, especially how it uses getDiscoveryRating to decide whether to show the Start Planning button, along with the placeholders like “What do you want to build?” The data flows through callNutAPI with streaming JSON. The planned summary appears in PlanView and switches to DevelopApp for continued building. I also need to mention the clarifying questions that appear in assistant messages with checkboxes. I need to figure out how event handling captures these checkboxes to send back without leaving holes in my understanding.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining project planning**

I want to make sure I answer the user's question about how project planning works in the repository. They seem to be seeking an explanation instead of code edits. So, I should focus on building intuition for how the planning process functions and how it asks clarifying questions to the user. Let’s explore this together and make sure the user gains a good understanding of the project planning workflow!
**Summarizing planning architecture**

I need to summarize our architecture, focusing on the differences between Discovery mode and Build mode. The UI captures user requirements with checkboxes and displays the StartPlanningButton when the discovery rating is greater than zero. Discovery responses come from the backend via NutAPI and are categorized as DiscoveryResponse. I’ll ensure the last DiscoveryResponse is tracked actively, and when users click checkboxes, their selections will be included in the message input. The planning logic likely runs in the backend with updates sent to the client.
**Crafting code explanation**

I need to provide a concise explanation with references to the code, using proper delimiters with line numbers and file paths for clarity. The user’s open file is SendChatMessage.ts, where I should cite ChatMode and `shouldDisplayMessage`. I also want to reference MessageInput.tsx for the start planning button and discovery rating retrieval. I'll touch on discovery categories in message.ts and how checkboxes are triggered in Messages.client.tsx. I’ll make sure to keep the citations minimal and ensure we include necessary status updates, while delivering a clear final answer.
**Outlining the high-level flow**

I want to clearly outline the high-level flow of the process. The user types an idea, and then the ChatImplementer sets the mode to Discovery. It sends the chat message and calls the NutAPI for streaming messages. When a response comes in, it merges those messages and updates the app summary. DiscoveryResponse messages are shown with checkboxes, which appear as markdown includes [ ] lines. 

When checkboxes toggle, it updates the message content and compiles a list of `checkedBoxes` that get added to the message body. The StartPlanning button shows when the discovery rating is greater than zero. Once pressed, it sets the ChatMode to BuildApp, and the backend emits an updated app summary. Additionally, the DiscoveryRating message provides a JSON rating, and `getDiscoveryRating` reads the last rating to filter what displays. Remember to follow markdown rules, using headings and bolding key parts!
**Preparing code citations**

I need to create code citations using triple backticks with the specific format for line ranges and file paths. For instance, in SendChatMessage.ts, lines 28-33 cover ChatMode and lines 50-57 detail shouldDisplayMessage. 

In ChatImplementer.tsx, I'll cite lines 166-175 for defaulting logic. Though we only have partial lines from the codebase_search, I won't quote from there but rather reference the logic explained. 

We'll also cite message.ts for lines 33-59, MessageInput.tsx for lines 210-245 regarding the StartPlanningButton, and Messages.client.tsx lines 214-224 for isActiveDiscoveryResponse. 

BaseChat.tsx covers ExamplePrompts and 'chatMode: Discovery' from lines 220-228. Finally, chat.ts lines 111-140 show handling app summary messages. 

Since this explanation is read-only, I’ll keep it concise and add a short summary at the end as needed.</details></think>

---

- I’ll outline the Discovery → Planning → Build flow and point to the exact places in code where it happens.
- Then I’ll show how clarifying questions are asked and captured (checkboxes) before starting to build.

### High-level flow
- Discovery starts by default. If you haven’t got a plan (`AppSummary`) yet, messages go in Discovery mode and the assistant asks clarifying questions.
- Once enough requirements are gathered (via DiscoveryRating), the UI offers a “Start planning/building” action to switch modes and produce an app plan (`AppSummary`).
- The plan renders in the workbench and you can proceed to build/iterate.

### Where modes and visibility are defined
- Chat modes (Discovery, BuildApp, etc.) and which messages are shown:

```28:33:app/lib/replay/SendChatMessage.ts
export enum ChatMode {
  BuildApp = 'BuildApp',
  Discovery = 'Discovery',
  DevelopApp = 'DevelopApp',
  FixDetectedError = 'FixDetectedError',
}
```

```50:57:app/lib/replay/SendChatMessage.ts
export function shouldDisplayMessage(message: Message) {
  return (
    message.role == 'user' ||
    message.category == DISCOVERY_RESPONSE_CATEGORY ||
    message.category == USER_RESPONSE_CATEGORY
  );
}
```

- Defaulting to Discovery until a plan exists is handled in the chat implementer (selecting `ChatMode.Discovery` when there’s no `appSummary`), then sending to the backend.

### How clarifying questions work
- The backend streams messages in categories. Discovery asks questions and updates a “discovery rating” that drives when to nudge the user to start planning:

```33:41:app/lib/persistence/message.ts
export const USER_RESPONSE_CATEGORY = 'UserResponse';

export const DISCOVERY_RESPONSE_CATEGORY = 'DiscoveryResponse';

export const DISCOVERY_RATING_CATEGORY = 'DiscoveryRating';
```

```48:59:app/lib/persistence/message.ts
export const MAX_DISCOVERY_RATING = 10;

export function getDiscoveryRating(messages: Message[]): number {
  const discoveryRatingMessage = messages.findLast((message) => message.category === DISCOVERY_RATING_CATEGORY);
  if (!discoveryRatingMessage) {
    return 0;
  }
  assert(discoveryRatingMessage.type === 'text', 'Discovery rating message is not a text message');
  const info: DiscoveryRating = JSON.parse(discoveryRatingMessage.content);
  return info.rating;
}
```

- The “Start planning/building” CTA shows up when DiscoveryRating > 0 and there’s no app summary yet:

```210:245:app/components/chat/MessageInput/MessageInput.tsx
const showSendButton = (hasPendingMessage || fullInput.length > 0 || uploadedFiles.length > 0) && chatStarted;
const showStartPlanningButton = startPlanningRating > 0 && !showSendButton && !hasAppSummary;
...
{showStartPlanningButton && (
  <ClientOnly>
    {() => (
      <StartPlanningButton
        onClick={() => {
          const message = (fullInput + '\n\nStart building the app based on these requirements.').trim();
          handleSendMessage({ messageInput: message, chatMode: ChatMode.BuildApp });
        }}
        startPlanningRating={startPlanningRating}
      />
    )}
  </ClientOnly>
)}
```

- Discovery questions can include Markdown checkboxes. Only the most recent DiscoveryResponse is “active” for user interaction:

```105:109:app/components/chat/Messages/Messages.client.tsx
let onCheckboxChange = undefined;
if (isActiveDiscoveryResponse(messages, message)) {
  onCheckboxChange = onLastMessageCheckboxChange;
}
```

```214:224:app/components/chat/Messages/Messages.client.tsx
function isActiveDiscoveryResponse(messages: Message[], message: Message) {
  for (let i = messages.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (messages[i].category === DISCOVERY_RESPONSE_CATEGORY) {
      return message.id === messages[i].id;
    }
    if (messages[i].category != DISCOVERY_RATING_CATEGORY) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

- When the user clicks checkboxes, the UI mutates the last DiscoveryResponse message content and collects the selected items; those get appended to the next message the user sends:

```126:151:app/components/chat/BaseChat/BaseChat.tsx
const onLastMessageCheckboxChange = (checkboxText: string, checked: boolean) => {
  const newMessages = chatStore.messages.get().map((message) => {
    if (message.type == 'text') {
      const oldBox = checked ? `[ ]` : `[x]`;
      const newBox = checked ? `[x]` : `[ ]`;
      const lines = message.content.split('\n');
      const matchingLineIndex = lines.findIndex(
        (line) => line.includes(oldBox) && lineIncludesNoMarkdown(line, checkboxText),
      );
      if (matchingLineIndex >= 0) {
        lines[matchingLineIndex] = lines[matchingLineIndex].replace(oldBox, newBox);
        return {
          ...message,
          content: lines.join('\n').trim(),
        };
      }
    }
    return message;
  });
  chatStore.messages.set(newMessages);
  if (checked) {
    setCheckedBoxes((prev) => [...prev, checkboxText]);
  } else {
    setCheckedBoxes((prev) => prev.filter((box) => box !== checkboxText));
  }
};
```

```110:113:app/components/chat/MessageInput/MessageInput.tsx
const fullInput =
  `${input ? input + '\n\n' : ''}` + (checkedBoxes ? `${checkedBoxes.map((box) => `${box}`).join('\n')}` : '');
```

### Kicking off Discovery
- When you pick a suggested “ExamplePrompt” on the landing screen, it explicitly sends a Discovery-mode message:

```222:228:app/components/chat/BaseChat/BaseChat.tsx
{ExamplePrompts((event: React.UIEvent, messageInput: string) => {
  if (hasPendingMessage) {
    handleStop?.();
    return;
  }
  handleSendMessage({ messageInput, chatMode: ChatMode.Discovery });
})}
```

### Where the plan shows up
- The backend eventually emits an `AppSummary` message; the client parses and stores it, then moves it out of chat and into the workbench plan UI:

```121:140:app/lib/stores/chat.ts
const { message } = response;
if (message.category === APP_SUMMARY_CATEGORY) {
  const appSummary = parseAppSummaryMessage(message);
  if (appSummary) {
    const existingSummary = chatStore.appSummary.get();
    if (!existingSummary || appSummary.iteration > existingSummary.iteration) {
      chatStore.appSummary.set(appSummary);
    }

    if (showPreview(appSummary) && existingRepositoryId != appSummary.repositoryId) {
      updateDevelopmentServer(appSummary.repositoryId);
    }
  }

  console.log('AppSummary', reason, appSummary?.iteration);
}

addChatMessage(response.message);
```

- The plan is rendered in the workbench (`PlanView`), where you can “Continue Building” to switch to `DevelopApp` mode:

```62:66:app/components/workbench/Preview/components/PlanView/PlanView.tsx
onClick={(event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  assert(appId, 'No app id');
  doSendMessage({ appId, mode: ChatMode.DevelopApp });
}}
```

### How messages reach the UI
- All chat is proxied to a remote “Nut” service over a streaming HTTP API; the client long-polls and streams newline-delimited JSON:

```25:41:app/lib/replay/NutAPI.ts
export async function callNutAPI(
  method: string,
  request: any,
  responseCallback?: ResponseCallback,
  overrideUserId?: string,
): Promise<any> {
...
```

```48:76:app/lib/replay/NutAPI.ts
if (responseCallback) {
  // Use native fetch for streaming
  const response = await fetch(url, fetchOptions);
  ...
  while ((newlineIdx = buffer.indexOf('\n')) !== -1) {
    const line = buffer.slice(0, newlineIdx).trim();
    ...
    if (line) {
      responseCallback(JSON.parse(line));
    }
  }
}
```

### TL;DR
- Discovery mode asks clarifying questions (often via Markdown checklists).
- You check boxes to confirm requirements; those are appended to your next message.
- A “Start planning/building” button appears when DiscoveryRating > 0 and no plan exists yet; clicking it switches to build mode.
- The backend responds with an `AppSummary` (the plan), which the workbench displays and you can continue building from there.

_**User (2025-09-04 13:04Z)**_

okay lets say I wanted to update my code so instead of relying on the ai adding - [ ] to the markdown I want to create a tool which will return an array of options and a selection mode (checkboxes or radiobuttons) 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying project for tool support**

I need to adapt the project to use a structured tool return that includes an array of options and a selection mode, instead of relying on markdown checkboxes. The user is asking to create a tool that returns this array, alongside the mode (like checkboxes or radio buttons). There's also a chat system that uses the Nut API for streaming messages. This “tool” seems like it's functioning more as an LLM function or tool call relying on a remote service for responses.
**Updating UI for structured options**

If the goal is to change the UI for structured options from the backend, I need to do a few things: 

First, I'll define a new message category called "ChoicePrompt" that includes a structured payload with an options array and a selection mode ('multi' or 'single'). Then, I’ll update the store and message rendering to support this new response type by displaying it as either a checkbox or radio list and capturing selections in the local UI state. I’ll also adjust the MessageInput to append selected options to the outgoing message when sending back to the Nut API.
**Adding client-side tool support**

I’m considering the possibility of adding a client-side tool for the AI. Currently, the chat system relies on a remote backend for orchestration. Introducing a "tool" suggests that the user wants to enhance the AI's function-calling capabilities. However, those functions will be implemented on the Nut backend instead of this codebase. On the frontend, I can support a new message category called 'ChoiceOptions' that contains a JSON with `mode` and `options`. If a message has the 'ChoicePrompt' category, I’ll render a component to display options, capturing selections for inclusion in the next message, and updating BaseChat for controlled state.
**Updating chat components**

I need to update `BaseChat.tsx` to manage the state of selected options from `ChoicePrompt`, moving away from markdown checkboxes. I’ll decide whether to remove existing markdown handling or keep it while adding a new path for the options. In `MessageInput.tsx`, I’ll display selected options and include them in the outgoing message, possibly appending them as text or sending them as a new message with the category 'UserSelection.' I also need to ensure that `ChoicePrompt` messages can be displayed and adjust the tracking mechanism for the latest `ChoicePrompt` message. Backward compatibility might be an option to keep markdown checkbox handling too. While testing locally sounds important, we can focus on the frontend implementation for the tool they want to create, which ties into the Nut backend.
**Implementing ChoicePrompt features**

I need to expose a type for handling the `ChoicePrompt` and `UserSelection` categories with their expected JSON schemas. In `app/lib/persistence/message.ts`, I’ll add constants for these categories and define their interfaces.

In `Messages/.../MessageContents.tsx`, I’ll replace markdown rendering with a custom component for `ChoicePrompt`, detecting when the message belongs to that category and using a new `ChoiceSelector` component. I'll get into callbacks here, modifying `Messages.client.tsx` to implement an `onChoiceChange` method for handling choices, while keeping `onCheckboxChange` for backward compatibility.

To facilitate structured options, I'll adjust how selections are appended in the `MessageInput` and ensure the backend receives the correct text lines for selected labels. Though users didn't expressly request structured outbound formats, I'll maintain simple text outputs while enhancing the inbound processing for structured prompts. 

Finally, I’ll update display conditions in `SendChatMessage.shouldDisplayMessage` and adjust the logic for `isActiveDiscoveryResponse` to incorporate `CHOICE_PROMPT_CATEGORY`. I’ll keep the existing checkbox handling and ensure I don’t interfere with the message content updates for `ChoicePrompt`.
**Implementing ChoicePrompt functionality**

I’ll start with collecting `checkedBoxes` in the system. In `MessageInput.tsx`, it already handles `checkedBoxes` at the top and appends them to `fullInput`, so that’s great! I'll add `CHOICE_PROMPT_CATEGORY` constants, set up the UI for rendering, and update the logic in `shouldDisplayMessage` and `isActiveDiscoveryResponse`. 

First, I’ll edit `message.ts` to export the `CHOICE_PROMPT_CATEGORY` and define the `ChoicePrompt` interface. Next, I’ll adjust `SendChatMessage.ts` to include `CHOICE_PROMPT_CATEGORY` in `shouldDisplayMessage`. In `Messages.client.tsx`, I’ll ensure it checks for either `DISCOVERY_RESPONSE_CATEGORY` or `CHOICE_PROMPT_CATEGORY`. 

Updating `MessageContents.tsx`, I’ll add logic to parse and render the choices based on the category, using checkboxes or radio buttons. Since `MessageContents` doesn’t receive the current selection, I might need an internal state to track the selections during rendering, which can reset for every new prompt that comes in. 

I’ll ensure the structure is clear and add the necessary imports and component types within `MessageContents.tsx`, adapting the logic to display the appropriate components based on the message type. I'll create the small new components for the choice prompts effectively.</details></think>

I'll open the full `MessageContents.tsx` to ensure I update its props and imports correctly and then implement the ChoicePrompt UI.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying message handling for tools**

I need to implement a change to support a tool that returns options with a selection mode for the user's use case. Instead of inserting markdown checkboxes, they want a structured UI similar to a ChoicePrompt. To do this, I might need to introduce a new message type or category for choices, while minimizing disruptive changes. One option could be using a new category named 'DiscoveryChoices', with the UI adapting to render options from JSON. I'll also need to manage interactions effectively, like handling checkbox changes.
**Integrating choice selection tools**

The user wants a selection mode with checkboxes or radio buttons that pass selected options to the input area, similarly to how `checkedBoxes` currently works. Right now, `BaseChat` handles state changes through `onLastMessageCheckboxChange`. I can generalize by adding an `onChoiceChange` callback that captures the selected option and status, reusing the logic for `checkedBoxes`. Meanwhile, I need to adapt the representation of options since we can't change the backend. The tool results will likely come from chat responses, and integrating everything might require tool calls to the backend.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering message structure**

I'm thinking about extending the message types in message.ts to include a new structured type, maybe called OptionPrompt. Currently, we have text and image, but could we encode this as a 'text' type with a category like 'ChoicePrompt' and some JSON content? Alternatively, maybe we could add a new 'form' type. The key is ensuring that message types include a 'type' field; also, we should consider how this fits with the display logic for messages.
**Refining message categories**

I'm thinking our new message category should still be DISCOVERY_RESPONSE_CATEGORY. Perhaps we keep the 'type' as 'text' but include a 'tool payload' for easier rendering. It might be better to add a 'tool' category while maintaining 'text' type. However, the display filter might hide anything that's not discovery-related, so let's keep that as 'DiscoveryResponse'. The backend will send JSON specifying options, and I wonder if we can add markers like 'tool: choice-prompt' to help with that.
**Designing ChoicePrompt support**

I'm thinking about how we can support 'ChoicePrompt' messages on the client side through message.category and content JSON. I need to decide whether to define a new constant, CHOICE_PROMPT_CATEGORY, or stick with DISCOVERY_RESPONSE_CATEGORY. The existing UI logic uses specific categories, so we could generalize it to handle both. To minimize changes, I think keeping it as DISCOVERY_RESPONSE_CATEGORY makes sense since the backend will set that anyway. I'll make sure MessageContents can detect 'choice prompt' payloads and render a `ChoicePrompt` component properly.
**Modifying MessageContents logic**

I need to modify `MessageContents.tsx` to handle new logic. When the message type is 'text' and the category is DISCOVERY_RESPONSE_CATEGORY, I want to check if the content starts with '{' to parse a JSON object that matches a specific shape: { kind: 'choice-prompt', selection: 'checkbox' or 'radio', options: string[] }. I could also include an optional prompt text. The user asked for a "tool" that streams an array of options, so I'll add a new message type for 'tool' content and introduce a new category, 'ChoicePrompt', in message.ts. We’ll also need to adjust `isActiveDiscoveryResponse` to consider both categories as interactive.
**Implementing ChoicePrompt component**

The guidelines suggest using the apply_patch tool through functions.apply_patch. I need to add a new file named `ChoicePrompt.tsx` in the `app/components/chat/Messages/components/` directory, while also updating `MessageContents.tsx` to parse JSON and render this new component. I'll maintain the two-space indentation style from `MessageContents.tsx`. The parser function will handle the content, and I plan to support both 'checkbox' and 'radio' as selection modes. We'll also allow optional title and description fields. Finally, I should handle input change logic for both checkboxes and radio buttons carefully.</details></think>

I'll add a new `ChoicePrompt` component to render structured options with checkbox or radio selection, and update `MessageContents.tsx` to detect and render it when the message content contains the choice-prompt JSON.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Integrating choice prompts**

I need to focus on integrating structured choice prompts since the user wants to update the code. Rather than relying on adding checkboxes in markdown, they want a tool that returns an array of options with a selection mode like checkboxes or radio buttons. 

This might mean we need to modify how responses are handled on the backend while I can work on the frontend. There might be a need to create a message format category for ChoicePrompt to facilitate this change.
**Creating structured options**

I’m thinking it’s better to establish a special category, like 'ChoicePrompt' or 'DiscoveryResponse,' for the tool payload. The user specifically asked for a tool that returns an array of options and a selection mode. In our code, I need to adapt the UI to parse structured JSON blocks to render checkboxes or radio buttons effectively.

I'll update the path for when a checkbox changes, so it feeds into the next message rather than relying on toggling hidden markdown. I’ll add the ChoicePrompt component and modify MessageContents.tsx to detect payloads with CHOICE_PROMPT. Plus, I might need to define a schema for this!
**Keeping detection local**

I’ve decided to keep detection local by parsing JSON in MessageContents.tsx. If the JSON matches the shape with `kind: 'choice-prompt'`, `options`, and `selectionMode`, I can render a ChoicePrompt. I’ll need to hook the onChange event to BaseChat’s onLastMessageCheckboxChange, which currently expects the literal checkbox line text.

To adapt this, I won’t mutate the message content for the structured prompt, but I still want to ensure we collect choices in `checkedBoxes` for the next send. I should tweak onLastMessageCheckboxChange to handle that effectively!
**Updating ChoicePrompt integration**

I can call the function with plain text and checked state, but it will try to modify message content by looking for checkbox markers like '[ ]'. If those aren't present, it won't change anything and will return the original messages, which is actually fine!

So I’ll call onLastMessageCheckboxChange with 'option' and checked. The mutate step won't find matches for [ ] or [x], so it'll just update the checkedBoxes state. Next, I need to pass `onChange` from MessageContents to ChoicePrompt. I'll import ChoicePrompt, parse message.content, and render it if the JSON includes `selectionMode` and `options` array.
**Implementing choice prompt updates**

I’m accepting an optional title and description. I also want to enhance category detection in `shouldDisplayMessage`, which only currently shows user messages or specific categories. It's fine if the structured choice prompt still uses DiscoveryResponse. For now, we'll stick with that and just change the content to JSON.

The HTML Markdown path will stay for other messages. I’ll need to provide status updates and a to-do list for this multi-step implementation. I'll use `todo_write` to track tasks like "Add ChoicePrompt component" and "Update MessageContents to render ChoicePrompt from JSON." After that, I'll ensure the selections are collected and displayed above the textarea. 

For `ChoicePrompt`, I'll add a property to disable input if there’s no `onChange`, and I can compute that with a simple check. I’ll also implement JSON parsing in MessageContents.tsx, preserving the tab/space indenting of the repository.</details></think>

I added a new `ChoicePrompt` component and will now update the message renderer to detect and render structured choice prompts from JSON content. Then I'll run a linter check on the changed files.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Developing a new tool**

I'm figuring out how to add a tool to the project that allows returning an array of options with a selection mode—checkboxes or radio buttons—instead of simply using "- [ ]" in markdown. This means we need to change how we render messages. We’ve already set up UI support using JSON for a structured ChoicePrompt. I need to consider how the input capture works, particularly with the onCheckboxChange function and its signature to ensure it's properly identifying checkboxes and updating the message accordingly.
**Addressing checkbox changes**

I'm looking at the code in BaseChat.onLastMessageCheckboxChange, which toggles markdown in message.content. Since this will now use JSON, it's not quite applicable anymore. We still need to manage the checkedBoxes state for input visibility and future appending. The existing toggle function won’t work with the structured ChoicePrompt, but I'll pass onCheckboxChange to it, sending the option label and boolean. If no matching line index is found, it just keeps the message unchanged, which is okay since we won’t alter the markdown content.
**Refining message logic**

The logic for displaying selected options above the textarea and appending them to the next message is functioning well, so minimal changes are needed there. I also need to tweak the code that identifies the active discovery response to ensure it only triggers on the latest DiscoveryResponse. However, structured messages might not belong to that category unless we update the server to emit them. Since the user asked for a tool to return specific options, we need to prepare the UI for parsing JSON with ChoicePrompt while keeping message categories intact.
**Updating components and running lints**

I might need to modify the `Markdown` component to stop intercepting checkboxes, but since we're branching to ChoicePrompt, that should be manageable. Next up, I plan to run lints for the modified files using the read_lints tool, as the guidelines indicate this should be done after any code edits. I also need to consider updating the TODO list. Since we didn't set any prior todos, I'll focus on providing micro-updates where necessary and ensure backend instructions specify sending assistant message content with the appropriate JSON structure.
**Clarifying tool implementation and updates**

The selection mode for 'radio' means only one option can be selected at a time, and I've implemented logic to support this. When a new option is selected, the previous one gets deselected, which is passed to the BaseChat handler to update checkedBoxes accordingly. I need to ensure users can submit their selection easily and maintain TypeScript consistency across files. 

The user also wants to create a new tool for the backend to call for sending structured prompt results. I’ll propose a JSON schema for that while ensuring checkedBoxes remain updated even with JSON content. Finally, I'll run read_lints on the two modified files to catch any issues.</details></think>

Running a quick lint check on the files I just edited to ensure no new issues were introduced.

- I added a structured `ChoicePrompt` UI and wired it into message rendering.
- Next step is to send such prompts from the backend by emitting a `message.content` JSON like:
```json
{
  "kind": "ChoicePrompt",
  "title": "Pick auth provider(s)",
  "description": "Select all that apply",
  "options": ["Email/Password", "Google", "GitHub", "Magic Link"],
  "selectionMode": "checkbox"
}
```

What changed:
- New `app/components/chat/Messages/components/ChoicePrompt.tsx` renders checkbox or radio options.
- `MessageContents.tsx` now detects `kind: "ChoicePrompt"` JSON and renders `ChoicePrompt`; otherwise falls back to Markdown.
- Checkbox/radio changes call the existing `onCheckboxChange(contents, checked)` callback, so selections continue to populate the input via the current checked-box pipeline.

If you want, I can also:
- Add a type-guard to validate the JSON shape.
- Extend the callback signature to return the full selected set.
